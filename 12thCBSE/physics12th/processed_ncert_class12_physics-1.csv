 Notice the important point that the dipole field at large distances
falls off not as 1/r 2 but as1/r 3 Further,  the magnitude and the direction
of the dipole field depends not only on the distance r but also on the
angle between the position vector r and the dipole moment p We can think of the limit when the dipole size 2a approaches zero,
the charge q approaches infinity in such a way that the product
p = q × 2a is finite Such a dipole is referred to as a point dipole"
