In 1637 Descartes gave the corpuscular model of light and derived Snell’s

bends towards the normal then the speed of light would be greater in the
second medium"

by Isaac Newton in his famous book entitled OPTICKS and because of
the tremendous popularity of this book, the corpuscular model is very
often attributed to Newton"
