metals; 4f (Ce to Lu) and 5f (Th to Lr) are known as
lanthanoids and actinoids respectively Originally the name transition metals was derived
from the fact that their chemical properties were

course, similar to that observed in an ordinary
transition series and is attributed to the same
cause, the imperfect shielding of one electron
by another in the same sub-shell However, the
shielding of one 4 f electron by another is less
than one d electron by another with the increase
in nuclear charge along the series There is
fairly regular decrease in the sizes with
increasing atomic number The cumulative effect of the contraction of

In the previous Unit, you have studied organic
compounds with functional groups containing carbon-
oxygen single bond In this Unit, we will study about the
organic compounds containing carbon-oxygen double
bond (>C=O) called carbonyl group, which is one of the
most important functional groups in organic chemistry In aldehydes, the carbonyl group is bonded to a
carbon and hydrogen while in the ketones, it is bonded
to two carbon atoms The carbonyl compounds in which
carbon of carbonyl group is bonded to carbon or
hydrogen and oxygen of hydroxyl moiety (-OH) are
known as carboxylic acids, while in compounds where
carbon is attached to carbon or hydrogen and nitrogen
of -NH2 moiety or to halogens are called amides and
acyl halides respectively"
