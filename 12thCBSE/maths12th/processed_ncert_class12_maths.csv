This clearly shows that to meet the purchase order of F1 and F2, the raw material
required is 335 units of R1, 467 units of R2 and 147 units of R3 which is much more than
the available raw material Since the amount of raw material required to manufacture
each unit of the three products is fixed, we can either ask for an increase in the
available raw material or we may ask the clients to reduce their orders Remark If we replace A in Example 3 by A1 given by

Therefore

= A′ + A (as (A′)′ = A)
= A + A′ (as A + B = B + A)

Therefore
B = A + A′ is a symmetric matrix
Now let
C = A – A′
C′ = (A – A′)′ = A′ – (A′)′     (Why )

discovery of simple method of elimination The arrangement of rods was precisely
that of the numbers in a determinant The Chinese, therefore, early developed the
idea of subtracting columns and rows as in simplification of a determinant

test instead of the second derivative test as the former is easy and short Example 24 Let AP and BQ be two vertical poles at
points A and B, respectively If AP = 16 m, BQ = 22 m

Example 4 Find the anti derivative F of  f defined by f (x) = 4x3 – 6, where F (0) = 3
Solution One anti derivative of f (x) is x4 – 6x since
(4

d
x – x
dx
 = 4x3 – 6
Therefore, the anti derivative F is given by
F(x) = x4 – 6x + C, where C is constant Given that
F(0) = 3, which gives,
3 = 0 – 6 × 0 + C    or    C = 3
Hence, the required anti derivative is the unique function F defined by
F(x) = x4 – 6x + 3"

Summary
� Integration is the inverse process of differentiation In the differential calculus,
we are given a function and we have to find the derivative or differential of
this function, but in the integral calculus, we are to find a function whose
differential is given Thus, integration is a process which is the inverse of
differentiation Let

1,4122-4125,"� Integration by substitution
A change in the variable of integration often reduces an integral to one of the
fundamental integrals The method in which we change the variable to some
other variable is called the method of substitution When the integrand involves
some trigonometric functions, we use some well known identities to find the

PROBABILITY      579
Solution Let A, E1, E2, E3 and E4 be the events as defined below :
A : a black ball is selected
E1 : box I is selected
E2 : box II is selected
E3 : box III is selected
E4 : box IV is selected
Since the boxes are chosen at random,
Therefore
P(E1) = P(E2) = P(E3) = P(E4) = 1

Also
P(A|E1) = 3
18 , P(A|E2) = 2
8 , P(A|E3) = 1
7  and  P(A|E4) = 4
